====================================

This project contains:
	+ src : contains the Java source files for this application
	+ resources (dependency) : contains images used in the application and the html user guide
	+ libs (dependency) : contains libraries used in the application
	+ credits : contains a text file giving credits for the resources and libraries
	used in this project.
	+ increment3.jar - runnable jar used to open the application
	+ Marketing Dashboard - Windows - folder containing an Windows executable file to launch 
	the app directly without installation
	+ Marketing Dashboard - Windows Installer - folder containing a runnable ".exe" 
	which bundles together the application and a Java Runtime Environment to use the tool in 
	a Windows environment without the need to install a JRE separately.


To run this application one can use the runnable jar provided: "increment3.jar".
Do not remove "resources" and "libs" folder or move the ".jar" file without them!

Alternatively, only for Windows users with a JVM installed, the executable "Marketing Dashboard.exe" 
located in the folder "Marketing Dashboard - Windows" can be used to start up the tool directly.
Do not remove the other files in this folder for correct functioning of this executable!

Also for Windows users only, "Marketing Dashboard-1.1.exe" standalone executable file, located in
"Marketing Dashboard - Windows Installer" can be used to run the application in a bundled JVM,
without the need to have a JVM installed on the machine! (automatic install)
